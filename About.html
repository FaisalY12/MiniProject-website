    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-warning text-dark">
        <p class="text-light bg-dark">Growing up in Kentwood, Louisiana, United States, Eurreal was said to resemble his father, Harper Montgomery, and was then called Little Brother Harper. The name then evolved into Little Brother Montgomery, and the nickname stuck. He started playing piano at the age of four, and by age 11 he left home for four years and played at barrel houses in Louisiana. He gained his main musical influence fromJelly Roll Morton, who used to visit the Montgomery household.</a></p>
        <p class="text-light bg-dark">Early in his career he performed at African-American lumber and turpentine camps in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. He then played with the bands of Clarence Desdunes and Buddy Petit. He lived in Chicago from 1928 to 1931, regularly playing at rent parties, and Chicago was where he made his first recordings. From 1931 through 1938 he led a band in Jackson, Mississippi. </p>
        <p class="text-light bg-dark">In 1942, Montgomery moved back to Chicago, which would be his home for the rest of his life, and went on tours to other cities in the United States and Europe. He toured briefly with Otis Rush in 1956. In the late 1950s he was discovered by a wider white audience. His fame grew in the 1960s, and he continued to make many recordings, some of them on his own record label, FM Records, which he formed in 1969 (FM stood for Floberg Montgomery, Floberg being the maiden name of his wife).</p>
        <p class="text-light bg-dark">Montgomery toured Europe several times in the 1960s and recorded some of his albums there. He appeared at many blues and folk festivals during the following decade and was considered a living legend, a link to the early days of blues in New Orleans.</p>
        <p class="text-light bg-dark">Among his original compositions are "Shreveport Farewell", "Farrish Street Jive", and "Vicksburg Blues". His instrumental Crescent City Blues served as the basis for a song of the same name by Gordon Jenkins, which in turn was adapted by Johnny Cash as "Folsom Prison Blues."</p>
        <p class="text-light bg-dark">Montgomery died on September 6, 1985, in Champaign, Illinois, and was interred in the Oak Woods Cemetery. In 2013, Montgomery was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.</p>
